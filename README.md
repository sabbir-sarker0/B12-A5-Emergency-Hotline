5. What is the difference between **preventDefault() and stopPropagation()** methods?
***Answer***
The preventDefault() method is used to prevent the browserâ€™s default behavior for an event, such as form submission or link navigation.

The stopPropagation() method is used to stop an event from bubbling up (or capturing down) the DOM tree, preventing parent or ancestor elements from receiving it.

While preventDefault() controls the default action of the browser, stopPropagation() controls the flow of the event through the DOM.
